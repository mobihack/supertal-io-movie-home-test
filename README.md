# Intro

Currently putting the requirements here. Will slowly make this a proper readme file

Create a production-grade app for the following requirements:

Develop a movies listing app with working Nodejs backend APIs. The App should have a bottom main navbar containing two tabs - Home & Favorites. The Home page should show all movies shown as thumbnails. Users will land on the movie detail screen (with basic details like Name, description, running time etc) by clicking on any movie thumbnail. Add a comment system on the movie detail page where the user can add comments. Users can also mark any movie as a favorite. The favorite tab will show all the movies that the user has marked as a favorite. Users can also un-mark any movie from their favorite list.
Add admin view as well to add and remove movies and comments
Notes: This is supposed to be a very simple app hence userâ€™s location information or city etc is not needed anywhere.

Evaluation will be based on code quality on both frontend & backend along with the database design. Make sure to include the db migration file within the code
