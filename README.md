# Intro

Currently putting the requirements here. Will slowly make this a proper readme file

Create a production-grade app for the following requirements:

Develop a movies listing app with working Nodejs backend APIs.

The App should have a bottom main navbar containing two tabs:

- Home
- Favorites

[X] The Home page should show all movies shown as thumbnails.
[X] Users will land on the movie detail screen (with basic details like Name, description, running time etc) by clicking on any movie thumbnail.
[X] Add a comment system on the movie detail page where the user can add comments.
[X] Users can also mark any movie as a favorite.
[X] The favorite tab will show all the movies that the user has marked as a favorite.
[X] Users can also un-mark any movie from their favorite list.

[X] Add admin view as well to add and remove movies and comments

Notes: This is supposed to be a very simple app hence userâ€™s location information or city etc is not needed anywhere.

Evaluation will be based on code quality on both frontend & backend along with the database design. Make sure to include the db migration file within the code
